Hi.
Orden here (16, Germany, student). Please don’t call me MyCodeNotWorking or MCNW-that’s just my GitHub name (or call me MCNW, I don't really care actually).
I'm working on:
Rapix (RapierJS + PixiJS) - a JS game engine/framework
and Minecraft Server Manager - an app I recently started to build with Electron. It lets you host your MC server for free from your PC and make it public with an easy-to-use GUI.
Looking for contributors to help finish the app. If you're interested, you can reach me on Discord: SirLochis#9294

I have experience with JS/TS, HTML, CSS + Tailwind, Vue, Electron, and other tools you unfortunately have to know as a full-stack developer these days.
Bye.
