Orden here (16, Germany, student). MCNW is just my github name.
Mainly working on Rapix (RapierJS + PixiJS), a js game engine/framework, and Minecraft Server Manager, an app I recently started developing with Electron. It lets you host your MC server for free from your PC and make it public with an easy-to-use GUI.
Looking for contributors to improve the app. You can reach me on Discord: SirLochis#9294

Stack: JS/TS, HTML, CSS + Tailwind, Vue, Electron, Python and some other fullstack tools, frameworks etc.
